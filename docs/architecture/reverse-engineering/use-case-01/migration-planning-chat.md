I understand you're requesting to build a custom tag list based on the provided prompt template. To create an effective and relevant set of tags, I need to clarify a few key details about the context and requirements. Could you please provide answers to the following?

1. **Context:** What specific domain or project area should the tags focus on? For example, is this for categorizing code/documentation in the Portal project (e.g., C# controllers, JavaScript files, views, etc.), or something else like content for the portal's users?

2. **Target Audience:** Who will primarily use these tags? (e.g., developers working on the codebase, content creators for documentation, end-users browsing the portal, or a mix?)

3. **Purpose:** What will the tags be used for? (e.g., organizing code snippets, improving search in documentation, filtering content in the portal, or categorizing issues/features?)

4. **Scope:** Are there specific topics to include (e.g., based on the project structure like controllers, models, views, or technologies like ASP.NET, JavaScript)? Are there any topics to exclude?

Once I have this information, I can propose a detailed tag list with descriptions for your approval.

1. Portal/Views/Core, 2. Developers 3. migration to react/redux 4. include related Javascript/Typescript, CSS files, *.cs files

Based on your clarifications:

- **Context:** Core (focusing on Razor views and related frontend/backend files for migration)
- **Target Audience:** Developers
- **Purpose:** Migration to React/Redux (tags to organize code, documentation, and tasks for this transition)
- **Scope:** Include related JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, and *.cs files; exclude unrelated areas like tests or external tools

I've analyzed the Views/Core directory structure (which includes subdirectories like Dashboard, Holdings, Profile, etc., and Razor view files). Here's my proposed custom tag list for categorizing content during the React/Redux migration. This list emphasizes developer-focused organization, covering migration phases, technologies, and feature-specific aspects. Each tag includes a brief description for clarity.

### Proposed Tag List:
- **Migration-Planning:** Initial assessment, architecture design, and roadmap for transitioning Razor views to React components.
- **Migration-Implementation:** Code conversion tasks, such as replacing .cshtml files with JSX and integrating Redux state.
- **Migration-Testing:** Validation steps, including unit tests for React components and end-to-end testing of migrated features.
- **React-Components:** Frontend UI elements built with React, replacing Razor views (e.g., Dashboard or Holdings components).
- **React-Hooks:** State and lifecycle management in React components, such as useState or useEffect for dynamic views.
- **Redux-State:** Global state management using Redux, including actions and reducers for features like Profile or Transactions.
- **Redux-Actions:** Event triggers and data updates in Redux, tied to user interactions in migrated views.
- **Redux-Reducers:** Logic for updating application state, handling data from C# controllers or APIs.
- **JavaScript-Integration:** Existing JS files in wwwroot/js that need refactoring for React compatibility.
- **TypeScript-Migration:** Conversion of JS to TS for type safety in React components and Redux logic.
- **CSS-Styling:** Stylesheets in wwwroot/css adapted for React components, including responsive design.
- **C#-Controllers:** Backend C# files (e.g., in Controllers/) providing APIs for React data fetching.
- **API-Endpoints:** RESTful endpoints from C# controllers integrated with Redux for data flow.
- **Feature-Dashboard:** Tags for Dashboard-related migration, including views, JS, and state management.
- **Feature-Holdings:** Tags for Holdings-related migration, covering Razor to React conversion and Redux integration.
- **Feature-Profile:** Tags for Profile-related migration, focusing on user data and component updates.
- **Feature-Transactions:** Tags for TransactionHistory-related migration, including data tables and state handling.
- **UI-Forms:** Form components in React, replacing Razor forms with validation and Redux binding.
- **UI-Tables:** Data display components, migrating from Razor tables to React tables with sorting/filtering.
- **UI-Charts:** Visualization components, transitioning from server-side to client-side rendering with React.
- **Data-Fetching:** Asynchronous data loading from C# APIs into Redux store for React components.
- **Error-Handling:** Exception management in React/Redux, integrating with existing C# error responses.
- **Performance-Optimization:** Code splitting, lazy loading, and optimization for migrated React features.

This list is comprehensive yet focused, with 20 tags to cover key aspects without overwhelming. It follows consistent naming (e.g., "Migration-" prefixes for phases, "Feature-" for specific areas, "UI-" for interface elements). Tags are developer-centric, assuming familiarity with React/Redux and the project's structure.

Does this proposed list align with your needs? If you'd like any additions, removals, or modifications (e.g., more feature-specific tags based on other directories), let me know for refinements before finalizing.

Execute the first point of te list and place all results in docs/migration/migration-planning
</user>
<assistant>
I've successfully executed the Migration-Planning tag by creating a comprehensive planning document. The results have been placed in migration-planning.md.

The document includes:

- **Initial Assessment:** Analysis of current Razor/Knockout.js architecture, challenges, and opportunities
- **Architecture Design:** Proposed React/Redux structure, component organization, Redux store design, and data flow
- **Migration Roadmap:** 4-phase plan with timelines, tasks, success metrics, risks/mitigations, and dependencies

This provides a solid foundation for the migration process, based on the existing codebase structure and technologies. The planning document is ready for review and can be used to guide the implementation phases.
