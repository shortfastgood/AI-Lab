## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the advantages and side effects of digital assisted work. 
Initially, it is a collection of experiences using GitHub's Copilot and OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Now, in September 2023, the exploratory phase begins for the use of LLM locally for applications whose data cannot be entrusted to the cloud.

## Technology Adoption Risks

The technology associated with LLM will not disappear, and thus ignoring it means still running the risk of being excluded from those emerging sectors and being penalized by those that will inevitably become obsolete.

Adoption also entails concrete risks, well characterized by a [specific section of OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/).

## Digital Assistant

This section explores the emerging functions of artificial intelligence and how to interact 
to get the greatest benefits.

### Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is new discipline that emerges from the enhanced capabilities of services based on LLMs to understand natural languages and correctly 
interpret the context of a request. In this regard, [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) offers an excellent guide for those who 
want to venture into this new profession.

See [Prompt Engineering Section](prompts/prompts.md) for examples.

### Economy

The economy, particularly the banking sector, can benefit from a system that can handle 
large amounts of data and texts simultaneously.

### SVG to Image

ChatGPT and Copilot cannot draw, but they are capable of translating human language into a graphical language. 
[SVG-to-Image](text-to-image/README.md) explores this approach.
