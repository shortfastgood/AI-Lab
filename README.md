## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the advantages and side effects of digital assisted work. 
Initially, it is a collection of experiences using GitHub's Copilot and OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## Digital Assistant

This section explores the emerging functions of artificial intelligence and how to interact 
to get the greatest benefits.

### Interactive Programming

In interactive programming, the human outlines what needs to be programmed in a form of technical specification 
made up of commands, and the artificial intelligence generates the code in the required language.

### Economy

The economy, particularly the banking sector, can benefit from a system that can handle 
large amounts of data and texts simultaneously.

### SVG to Image

ChatGPT and Copilot cannot draw, but they are capable of translating human language into a graphical language. 
[SVG-to-Image](text-to-image/README.md) explores this approach.
