## Introduction
(also *vibecoding*) is an AI-driven programming approach where developers describe the desired functionality in natural language and a large language model (LLM) generates the corresponding source code. This shifts the programmer’s role from writing code to guiding, testing, and refining the AI’s output. The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025. By leveraging powerful code-generating AI, vibe coding aims to streamline software development.

### Key Advantages
- **Cost Reduction:** Automating code creation with AI can significantly lower development costs. A single individual can build software that previously required an entire engineering team. For example, Salesforce saw a **30% increase in developer productivity** after adopting AI coding tools – enough efficiency gain that the company halted new engineering hires for 2025.
- **Increased Productivity:** Vibe coding dramatically accelerates development. Experienced programmers report completing tasks in minutes that would traditionally take half an hour. This rapid turnaround enables faster prototyping and allows developers to focus more on design and problem-solving, rather than boilerplate coding.

### Potential Risks
- **Errors and Bugs:** AI-generated code can be error-prone or behave unexpectedly. Without careful oversight, subtle bugs or security vulnerabilities may go unnoticed in AI-written code. In one experiment, an LLM-generated app even fabricated fake content (misinterpreting the requirements) during a trial, illustrating how unpredictable the output can be.
- **Misunderstandings:** If a prompt is ambiguous, the AI might misinterpret the intent, leading to features that don’t meet the specifications. Moreover, a developer who accepts code without fully understanding it (a common occurrence in vibe coding) will struggle to debug or maintain that code later. This lack of human understanding and clarity can pose serious risks, especially in complex or safety-critical systems.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Thorough Testing & Review:** Treat AI-generated code as inherently fallible. Developers should rigorously test all AI-produced outputs and review the code line-by-line before integrating it. No code should be deployed until the team can explain its behavior and verify its correctness, just as with hand-written code.
- **Clear Prompts & Iteration:** To avoid misunderstandings, specify requirements to the AI as clearly as possible. Ambiguity in prompts should be minimized. Use an iterative approach: analyze the AI’s output, provide feedback or refined prompts, and re-run until the code aligns with the intended behavior. This feedback loop helps correct the AI’s course and reduces misinterpretation.
- **Selective Use in Low-Stakes Projects:** Limit vibe coding to prototypes, non-critical features, or personal projects where errors are tolerable. For high-stakes or production software, a hybrid approach is safer – leveraging AI assistance for speed, but keeping human developers in the loop for design decisions, code reviews, and final implementations. By confining full “vibe coding” to safe contexts and enforcing human oversight for important code, teams can reap the productivity benefits while avoiding most pitfalls.

## Slop AI

The content in the introduction was generated by an artificial intelligence. The text is coherent and may lead readers to believe that the described process has some value.

The reality is quite different, as the variety in responses —ranging from hallucinations to excellence, with many answers being mediocre or poor— from artificial intelligence to any request is extremely high.

This situation is well described by Shannon's information theory, which defines entropy as a measure of uncertainty and unpredictability. Vibe coding introduces a level of entropy that far exceeds the system's capacity, potentially driving it out of control.

It should be noted that artificial intelligence always provides an answer, even when it lacks sufficient knowledge to do so. As a result, it may generate a response that appears plausible but fully invented. Obvious hallucinations are relatively rare and not easily detected at first glance.

The solution is to reduce entropy by limiting variety and simplifying complex operations. Artificial intelligence should be guided in the desired direction by incrementally adding instructions and knowledge, for example, through concrete examples of how to proceed.
