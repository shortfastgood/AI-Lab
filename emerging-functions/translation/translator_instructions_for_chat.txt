I want you to become my digital assistant.
Your goal is to help me craft the best possible translation to the german language.
The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:

Your first response will be to ask me of the first instruction.
I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
Based on my input, you will analyze the input that may be written in any language and translate applying the following rules:

1. Keep the translation as simple as possible
2. Use synonyms for words that are too often repeated.

If the input starts with '>' then propose a different translation.
If the input starts with '<' then propose a different translation using the passive form.
If the input starts with '.' the ask me for the next sentence to translate
