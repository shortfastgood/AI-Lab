      " Agile teams should actively seek to make themselves redundant by fostering quality of self-organization in teams . Agile change is not done for its own sake but to improve delivery of value . Avatars can be used on both Scrum and Kanban boards to show which team member is progressing each item . Backlogs and queue management principles of queue management are applicable to all agile methods . A sized and ordered backlog allows estimates to be made  about the likely time of item completion, assuming that the velocity of delivery is known .\n"
