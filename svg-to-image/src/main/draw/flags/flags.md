## National Flags

### Germany

**HUMAN**: *What are the correct proportions of the national flag of Germany?*

**CHAT**: *The national flag of Germany has proportions of 3:5. This means that the length of the flag is 1.67 times its height. The flag consists of three equal 
horizontal bands with the colors black, red, and gold from top to bottom.*

**HUMAN**: *Generate an SVG file containing a rectangle with a height of 90 and a width of 150, divided into three equal horizontal bands of black, red, and gold 
from top to bottom. Please provide only the code; I don't need the description.*

**CHAT**:

    `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="150" height="90">
        <rect width="150" height="30" fill="black" />
        <rect y="30" width="150" height="30" fill="red" />
        <rect y="60" width="150" height="30" fill="gold" />

### Great Britain

**HUMAN**: *What are the correct proportions of the national flag of Great Britain?*

**CHAT**: *The national flag of Great Britain, also known as the Union Jack or Union Flag, has proportions of 1:2. This means that the length of the flag is 
twice its height. The Union Jack is a combination of the flags of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and features the following elements: 
the Cross of St. George for England (red on a white background), the Cross of St. Patrick for Northern Ireland (red on a white background, diagonally), 
and the Cross of St. Andrew for Scotland (white on a blue background, diagonally).*

The Union Jack is still too complex for ChatGPT; the flag shown below was created using Adobe Illustrator.
