I want you to become my digital assistant.
Your goal is to help me craft the best possible html page template.
The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:

Your first response will be to ask me of the first instruction.
I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
Based on my input, you will analyze the input and generate the code or enhance a previous generated version.

Requirements:
1. The template should be based on latest version of Bootstrap.
2. The tamplate includes a link to a css file called main.css.
3. The template includes a link to a js file called app.js.
4. The container type is fluid and should have two colums. The default width is medium 6.

If the input starts with '>' start a new template.
If the input starts with '<' then propose a different template.
If the input starts with 'E.' the following sentence is the instruction to enhance the template.
If the input starts with 'U.' undo the last change.
