I use this technique to provide context to individual chats, making them specific to a certain sector or functionality rather than being generic.

### Image Generator

The generation of images through artificial intelligence is currently very controversial. It is a very useful discipline to support auxiliary 
graphic activities. For instance, when needing to produce an icon for a new application with some meaningful representation, using a traditional 
editor requires hours of work, especially if graphics aren't central to our daily activities. By using a prompt generator and inputting the results 
into an application that produces images from text, we can obtain a dozen professional-level proposals in just a few minutes.

The controversy lies in the fact that designers, who still use their imagination and traditional tools, see their market share being taken away, 
while the customer obtains comparable images at almost no cost. In this scenario, it will be challenging to resist the new trend.

In the realm of art, on the other hand, it's reasonable to ask whether the recombination of styles and ideas done by artificial intelligence 
can be considered an artistic movement. If we accept this premise, we run the risk of flattening our culture, because artificial intelligence 
truly lacks imagination.

### Natural Language Translator

One of these sectors is translations into a foreign language. The condition for use is that the user has sufficient knowledge to determine 
if the translation is contextualized and not offensive. The advantage is that one often expands their knowledge of the language in question. 
The source can also be a fairly complex paragraph, but not entire documents.
