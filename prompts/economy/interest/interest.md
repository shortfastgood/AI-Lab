# CASE STUDY: interest

**question**: What is the difference between compound interest and amortized interest?

**answer**: Compound interest and amortized interest are two different ways of calculating and applying interest on a loan or investment. Here is a brief explanation of the differences between the two:

**Compound interest**:
Compound interest refers to the process of calculating interest on an initial principal (or capital) and the accumulated interest over time. In other words, you earn or pay interest not only on the initial principal but also on the interest that has accrued in previous periods. Compound interest is common in long-term investments and savings, such as savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
Compound interest formula:
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
Where:
A = final amount (principal + interest)
P = initial principal
r = annual interest rate (in decimal form)
n = number of times interest is compounded per year
t = number of years

**Amortized interest**:
Amortized interest is the method used to calculate interest and allocate loan repayment between principal and interest over time. With amortization, each periodic payment is divided into a principal portion and an interest portion. At the beginning of the amortization schedule, a larger share of the monthly payment goes toward interest and a smaller share goes toward reducing the principal. As the loan balance decreases, the interest portion decreases, while the principal portion increases. Amortized interest is common in personal loans, mortgage loans, and auto loans.
Amortized loan formula (to calculate the monthly payment):
Monthly payment = P * (r(1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1)
Where:
P = loan amount
r = monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12 months)
n = number of payments (years * 12 months)

In summary, compound interest primarily applies to investments and savings and concerns the accumulation of interest on interest, while amortized interest applies to loans and concerns the allocation of payments between principal and interest over time.

**command**: calculate month by month the interest paid, the principal repayment and the total repayment for a loan of 250000$ with amortised interest rate of 1,25% over 5 years. Put the results in a table formatted CSV using a colon as separator. Please do not generate any description.
